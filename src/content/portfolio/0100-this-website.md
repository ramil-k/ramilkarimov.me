# ramilkarimov.me

It works as my portfolio and as a showcase for my skills.

## Design

Overall, I'm working on a responsive website with simple but bright design system.

### Font

I selected [Bellota font](https://github.com/kemie/Bellota-Font) as the main font.
Probably will add more readable font with higher contrast to make portfolio articles more readable.
For now, while the amount of the text on site is quite small, Bellota looks reasonable.

### Colors

I based my color scheme on [Evil Martians Harmony](https://evilmartians.com/opensource/harmony) and added few of more vibrant colors to make some accents pop more.

### Icons

I'm using Sergey Chikin's [365 icons pack](https://sergeychikin.ru/365/).

## Technologies

### Astro

For the personal portfolio, I don't need React or Svelte, Next or Sveltekit. Astro helps me to build this static website, in the future, I'm planning to add interactivity using either Astro's mechanisms, or iframes to the other apps.

### Tailwind

Tailwind works as a simple constructor, that allows to build and experiment on the website with high speed.

### Netlify

For the personal website, the netlify's free instance is enough. It builds the website from the github repo.
