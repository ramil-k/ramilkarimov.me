# ramilkarimov.me

It works as my portfolio and as a showcase for my skills.

## Design

Overall, I'm working on a responsive website with simple but bright design system.

### Font

I selected [Bellota font](https://github.com/kemie/Bellota-Font) as the main font.
Probably will add more readable font with higher contrast to make portfolio articles more readable.
For now, while the amount of the text on site is quite small, Bellota looks reasonable.

### Colors

I based my color scheme on [Evil Martians Harmony](https://evilmartians.com/opensource/harmony) and added few of more vibrant colors to make some accents pop more.

### Icons

I'm using Sergey Chikin's [365 icons pack](https://sergeychikin.ru/365/).

## Technologies

### Astro

### Tailwind

### Netlify
