**Role:** Developer of the desktop electron app and AWS administrator.

**Tasks and Accomplishments:**

Worked on refining and maintaining an Electron application. My responsibilities included fixing bugs, implementing new features, and supporting infrastructure.

Automated the build and signing processes using GitHub Actions, allowing all builds to be compiled and deployed to AWS S3. This significantly reduced release time and minimized errors related to manual operations.

Enhanced the backend on AWS Lambda and CDK by establishing connections between infrastructure elements and adding new endpoints that return processed statistics.

Merged three repositories into a single monorepository with builds for all platforms. The original repositories differed in some platform-specific details. I consolidated the large shared portion into a unified module and extracted small platform-dependent parts into separate modules linked to the main one. Used Turborepo to organize the build pipeline.

Reworked the structure of the Electron application to eliminate unnecessary duplication.
