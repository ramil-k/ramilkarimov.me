### Project: Pyroblast

Gamer-oriented chat platform, got cancelled.

**Role:** Developer of the desktop electron app.

**Tasks and Accomplishments:**

- Developed a desktop app on electron from scratch. Using sveltekit, vite, supabase, typescript and turborepo.
  Sveltekit in a static site generation and spa mode allowed pretty straight forward routing and components for the app.
  Supabase is a great OSS backend as a service platform. It provides authentication, database and a real time communication.
  Vite for sveltekit and electron resources build.
- Automated builds for all platforms using github actions and telegram bot to report links on success build.
- Implemented authentication with google and email. Set up links from the email to open in an app.
- Added to designerâ€™s pipeline usage of design tokens and added generation of the css variables based on it.
- Used turborepo to create monorepository and separate applications (web and electron) components, generated styles, types and other helpers (such as storybook).
- Made the layout of the app with right-to-left languages in mind, so that arab, jew and asian natives would be able to use an app more compfortable.
